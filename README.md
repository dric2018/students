# students
A basic python tkinter project app for students management.

Just have fun guys !

# Config
1. Frist you will need to install mysql server on your system for the database to be created and populated.
For this project I have used __xamp__ server which already includes mysql.
[XAMP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/fr/index.html)

2. Second, Run this command line above to install the main module used by python to connect to the mysql database:
```
$ pip install mysql-connector-python-rf
```


# Usage
1. Run partie_1.py script to initilaize the project with its database and first table
  ```
  $ python partie_1.py
  ```
2. Then, Run partie_2.py script to create and populate the second table.
  ```
  $ python partie_2.py
  ```
3. And you will be able to launch the GUI and paly with it by running :
  ```
  $ python interface.py
  ```
